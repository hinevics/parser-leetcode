       "    'content': '# Intuition\\\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\\\nThe Two Sum problem asks us to find two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. We need to return the indices of these two numbers.\\\\n# Approach\\\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\\\n1. One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target. This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).\\\\n2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table.\\\\n\\\\n**Approach using a hash table:**\\\\n1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.\\\\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\\\\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].\\\\n4. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.\\\\n5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash table with its index as the value.\\\\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.\\\\n7. If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) since hash table lookups take constant time on average. It allows us to solve the Two Sum problem efficiently by making just one pass through the array.\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n# Solution 1: (Brute Force)\\\\n```C++ []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        for (int i = 0;

       "    'content': '# Intuition\\\\nMethod 1: A brute-force solution to find two numbers in the nums list that add up to the target value.\\\\n\\\\nMethod 2: By list concept\\\\n\\\\nMethod 3: By Dictionary (more efficient solution)\\\\n# Approach\\\\nMethod 1: \\\\nThe code uses nested loops to iterate over each pair of numbers in the nums list. The outer loop runs from 0 to len(nums)-1, and the inner loop runs from i+1 to len(nums)-1, where i is the current index of the outer loop. Within the nested loops, constant time operations are performed, such as checking if the sum of two numbers equals the target, appending indices to the a list, and using break and continue statements.\\\\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n^2) due to the nested loops.\\\\n\\\\nMethod 2: \\\\nThe code uses one loop to iterate over the number and subtract from target and if that subtracted number is present in list then return the index of both number. \\\\n(here if condition of a==i means that possibly the target is 10 and present number in list might be [5,5] but it will return the same index so we need to skip)\\\\n\\\\nMethod 3: \\\\nThe dictionary will help us to find the complement of each number more efficiently. In Method 2, Change the loop variable from i to num using the enumerate() function. This allows us to directly access the numbers from the nums list instead of using indexing.\\\\nReplaced the variable p with complement to improve code readability.\\\\nReplaced if p in nums with if complement in num_dict. This change allows us to check if the complement exists in the num_dict dictionary, which provides a more efficient lookup compared to the in operator on a list.\\\\nModified the return statement to return [num_dict[complement], i] instead of i, a. This returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, as required.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n\\\\nMethod 1: \\\\nO(n^2) due to nested loops\\\\n\\\\nMethod 2: \\\\nO(n^2) because the the code uses a single loop that iterates over each element in the nums list which takes O(n) and index() method is called within the loop which takes O(n) time in the worst case to call the index of element.\\\\n\\\\nMethod 3: \\\\n**O(n)**  The use of the dictionary (num_dict) allows for efficient lookup of complements in constant time, improving the overall time complexity to O(n) compared to the previous methods with a time complexity of O(n^2) when using the brute force and index() method.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\nthe space complexity of the code is O(1) in all 3 methods.\\\\n\\\\n$$PLEASE$$ $$UPVOTE$$\\\\n# Code\\\\n\\\\nMethod 1: \\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        a=[]\\\\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\\\\n            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):\\\\n                if (nums[i]+nums[j]==target):\\\\n                    a.append(i)\\\\n                    a.append(j)\\\\n                    break\\\\n                else:\\\\n                    continue        \\\\n        return a\\\\n```\\\\nMethod 2:\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        a=0\\\\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\\\\n            p = target-nums[i]\\\\n            if p in nums:\\\\n                a=nums.index(p)\\\\n                if a==i:\\\\n                    continue\\\\n                break\\\\n        return i,a\\\\n```\\\\nMethod 3:\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        num_dict = {}\\\\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\\\n            complement = target - num\\\\n            if complement in num_dict:\\\\n                return [num_dict[complement], i]\\\\n            num_dict[num] = i\\\\n        return []\\\\n```',\n",

       "    'content': 'If you\\\\\\'re a newbie and sometimes have a hard time understanding the logic. Don\\\\\\'t worry, you\\\\\\'ll catch up after a month of doing Leetcode on a daily basis. Try to do it, even one example per day. It\\\\\\'d help. I\\\\\\'ve compiled a bunch on `sum` problems here, go ahead and check it out. Also, I think focusing on a subject and do 3-4 problems would help to get the idea behind solution since they mostly follow the same logic. Of course there are other ways to solve each problems but I try to be as uniform as possible. Good luck. \\\\n\\\\nIn general, `sum` problems can be categorized into two categories: 1) there is any array and you add some numbers to get to (or close to) a `target`, or 2) you need to return indices of numbers that sum up to a (or close to) a `target` value.  Note that when the problem is looking for a indices, `sort`ing the array is probably NOT a good idea. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n **[Two Sum:](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**  \\\\n \\\\n This is the second type of the problems where we\\\\\\'re looking for indices, so sorting is not necessary. What you\\\\\\'d want to do is to go over the array, and try to find two integers that sum up to  a `target` value. Most of the times, in such a problem, using dictionary (hastable) helps. You try to keep track of you\\\\\\'ve observations in a dictionary and use it once you get to the results. \\\\n\\\\nNote: try to be comfortable to use `enumerate` as it\\\\\\'s sometime out of comfort zone for newbies. `enumerate` comes handy in a lot of problems (I mean if you want to have a cleaner code of course). If I had to choose three built in functions/methods that I wasn\\\\\\'t comfortable with at the start and have found them super helpful, I\\\\\\'d probably say `enumerate`, `zip` and `set`. \\\\n \\\\nSolution: In this problem, you initialize a dictionary (`seen`). This dictionary will keep track of numbers (as `key`) and indices (as `value`). So, you go over your array (line `#1`) using `enumerate` that gives you both index and value of elements in array. As an example, let\\\\\\'s do `nums = [2,3,1]` and `target = 3`. Let\\\\\\'s say you\\\\\\'re at index `i = 0` and `value = 2`, ok? you need to find `value = 1` to finish the problem, meaning, `target - 2 = 1`. 1 here is the `remaining`. Since `remaining + value = target`, you\\\\\\'re done once you found it, right? So when going through the array, you calculate the `remaining` and check to see whether `remaining` is in the `seen` dictionary (line `#3`). If it is, you\\\\\\'re done! you\\\\\\'re current number and the remaining from `seen` would give you the output (line `#4`). Otherwise, you add your current number to the dictionary (line `#5`) since it\\\\\\'s going to be a `remaining` for (probably) a number you\\\\\\'ll see in the future assuming that there is at least one instance of answer.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n ```\\\\n class Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        seen = {}\\\\n        for i, value in enumerate(nums): #1\\\\n            remaining = target - nums[i] #2\\\\n            \\\\n            if remaining in seen: #3\\\\n                return [i, seen[remaining]]  #4\\\\n            else:\\\\n                seen[value] = i  #5\\\\n```\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n **[Two Sum II:](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)**  \\\\n\\\\nFor this, you can do exactly as the previous. The only change I made below was to change the order of line `#4`. In the previous example, the order didn\\\\\\'t matter. But, here the problem asks for asending order and since the values/indicess in `seen` has always lower indices than your current number, it should come first.  Also, note that the problem says it\\\\\\'s not zero based, meaning that indices don\\\\\\'t start from zero, that\\\\\\'s why I added 1 to both of them. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        \\\\n        seen = {}\\\\n        for i, value in enumerate(numbers): \\\\n            remaining = target - numbers[i] \\\\n           \\\\n            if remaining in seen: \\\\n                return [seen[remaining]+1, i+1]  #4\\\\n            else:\\\\n                seen[value] = i  \\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAnother approach to solve this problem (probably what Leetcode is looking for) is to treat it as first category of problems. Since the array is already sorted, this works. You see the following approach in a lot of problems. What you want to do is to have two pointer (if it was 3sum, you\\\\\\'d need three pointers as you\\\\\\'ll see in the future examples). One pointer move from `left` and one from `right`. Let\\\\\\'s say you `numbers = [1,3,6,9]` and your `target = 10`. Now, `left` points to 1 at first, and  `right` points to 9. There are three possibilities. If you sum numbers that `left` and `right` are pointing at, you get `temp_sum` (line `#1`). If `temp_sum` is your target, you\\\\\\'r done! You\\\\\\'re return it (line `#9`). If it\\\\\\'s more than your `target`, it means that `right` is poiting to a very large value (line `#5`) and you need to bring it a little bit to the left to a smaller (r maybe equal) value (line `#6`)  by adding one to the index . If the `temp_sum` is less than `target` (line `#7`), then you need to move your `left` to a little bit larger value by adding one to the index (line `#9`). This way, you try to narrow down the range in which you\\\\\\'re looking at and will eventually find a couple of number that sum to `target`, then, you\\\\\\'ll return this in line `#9`. In this problem, since it says there is only one solution, nothing extra is necessary. However, when a problem asks to return all combinations that sum to `target`, you can\\\\\\'t simply return the first instace and you need to collect all the possibilities and return the list altogether (you\\\\\\'ll see something like this in the next example). \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        \\\\n        for left in range(len(numbers) -1): #1\\\\n            right = len(numbers) - 1 #2\\\\n            while left < right: #3\\\\n                temp_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right] #4\\\\n                if temp_sum > target:  #5\\\\n                    right -= 1 #6\\\\n                elif temp_sum < target: #7\\\\n                    left +=1 #8\\\\n                else:\\\\n                    return [left+1, right+1] #9\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[**3Sum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)\\\\n\\\\nThis is similar to the previous example except that it\\\\\\'s looking for three numbers. There are some minor differences in the problem statement. It\\\\\\'s looking for all combinations (not just one) of solutions returned as a list. And second, it\\\\\\'s looking for unique combination, repeatation is not allowed. \\\\n\\\\nHere, instead of looping (line `#1`) to `len(nums) -1`, we loop to `len(nums) -2` since we\\\\\\'re looking for three numbers. Since we\\\\\\'re returning values, `sort` would be a good idea. Otherwise, if the `nums` is not sorted, you cannot reducing `right` pointer or increasing `left` pointer easily, makes sense? \\\\n\\\\nSo, first you `sort` the array and define `res = []` to collect your outputs. In line `#2`, we check wether two consecutive elements are equal or not because if they are, we don\\\\\\'t want them (solutions need to be unique) and will skip to the next set of numbers. Also, there is an additional constrain in this line that `i > 0`. This is added to take care of cases like `nums = [1,1,1]` and `target = 3`. If we didn\\\\\\'t have `i > 0`, then we\\\\\\'d skip the only correct solution and would return `[]` as our answer which is wrong (correct answer is `[[1,1,1]]`.  \\\\n\\\\nWe define two additional pointers this time, `left = i + 1` and `right = len(nums) - 1`. For example, if `nums = [-2,-1,0,1,2]`, all the points in the case of `i=1` are looking at: `i` at `-1`, `left` at `0` and `right` at `2`. We then check `temp` variable similar to the previous example. There is only one change with respect to the previous example here between lines `#5` and `#10`.  If we have the `temp = target`, we obviously add this set to the `res` in line `#5`, right? However, we\\\\\\'re not done yet. For a fixed `i`, we still need to check and see whether there are other combinations by just changing `left` and `right` pointers. That\\\\\\'s what we are doing in lines `#6, 7, 8`. If we still have the condition of `left < right` and `nums[left]` and the number to the right of it are not the same, we move `left` one index to right (line `#6`). Similarly, if `nums[right]` and the value to left of it is not the same, we move `right` one index to left. This way for a fixed `i`, we get rid of repeative cases. For example, if `nums = [-3, 1,1, 3,5]` and `target = 3`, one we get the first `[-3,1,5]`, `left = 1`, but, `nums[2]` is also 1 which we don\\\\\\'t want the `left` variable to look at it simply because it\\\\\\'d again return `[-3,1,5]`, right? So, we move `left` one index. Finally, if the repeating elements don\\\\\\'t exists, lines `#6` to `#8` won\\\\\\'t get activated. In this case we still need to move forward by adding 1 to `left` and extracting 1 from `right` (lines `#9, 10`). \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\n        \\\\n        nums.sort()\\\\n        res = []\\\\n\\\\n        for i in range(len(nums) -2): #1\\\\n            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: #2\\\\n                continue\\\\n            left = i + 1 #3\\\\n            right = len(nums) - 1 #4\\\\n            \\\\n            while left < right:  \\\\n                temp = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]\\\\n                                    \\\\n                if temp > 0:\\\\n                    right -= 1\\\\n                    \\\\n                elif temp < 0:\\\\n                    left += 1\\\\n                \\\\n                else:\\\\n                    res.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]) #5\\\\n                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]: #6\\\\n                        left += 1\\\\n                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right-1]:#7\\\\n                        right -= 1    #8\\\\n                \\\\n                    right -= 1 #9 \\\\n                    left += 1 #10\\\\n                       \\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAnother way to solve this problem is to change it into a two sum problem. Instead of finding `a+b+c = 0`, you can find `a+b = -c` where we want to find two numbers `a` and `b` that are equal to `-c`, right? This is similar to the first problem. Remember if you wanted to use the exact same as the first code, it\\\\\\'d return indices and not numbers. Also, we need to re-arrage this problem in a way that we have `nums` and `target`. This code is not a good code and can be optimipized but you got the idea. For a better version of this, check [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/discuss/7384/My-Python-solution-based-on-2-sum-200-ms-beat-93.37). \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        nums.sort()\\\\n        \\\\n        for i in range(len(nums)-2):\\\\n            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\\\\n                continue\\\\n            output_2sum = self.twoSum(nums[i+1:], -nums[i])\\\\n            if output_2sum ==[]:\\\\n                continue\\\\n            else:\\\\n                for idx in output_2sum:\\\\n                    instance = idx+[nums[i]]\\\\n                    res.append(instance)\\\\n        \\\\n        output = []\\\\n        for idx in res:\\\\n            if idx not in output:\\\\n                output.append(idx)\\\\n                \\\\n        \\\\n        return output\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums, target):\\\\n        seen = {}\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        for i, value in enumerate(nums): #1\\\\n            remaining = target - nums[i] #2\\\\n           \\\\n            if remaining in seen: #3\\\\n                res.append([value, remaining])  #4\\\\n            else:\\\\n                seen[value] = i  #5\\\\n            \\\\n        return res\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[**4Sum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)\\\\n\\\\nYou should have gotten the idea, and what you\\\\\\'ve seen so far can be generalized to `nSum`. Here, I write the generic code using the same ideas as before. What I\\\\\\'ll do is to break down each case to a `2Sum II` problem, and solve them recursively using the approach in `2Sum II` example above. \\\\n\\\\nFirst sort `nums`, then I\\\\\\'m using two extra functions, `helper` and `twoSum`. The `twoSum` is similar to the `2sum II` example with some modifications. It doesn\\\\\\'t return the first instance of results, it check every possible combinations and return all of them now. Basically, now it\\\\\\'s more similar to the `3Sum` solution. Understanding this function shouldn\\\\\\'t be difficult as it\\\\\\'s very similar to `3Sum`. As for `helper` function, it first tries to check for cases that don\\\\\\'t work (line `#1`). And later, if the `N` we need to sum to get to a `target` is 2 (line `#2`), then runs the `twoSum` function. For the more than two numbers, it recursively breaks them down to two sum (line `#3`). There are some cases like line `#4` that we don\\\\\\'t need to proceed with the algorithm anymore and we can `break`. These cases include if multiplying the lowest number in the list by `N` is more than `target`. Since its sorted array, if this happens, we can\\\\\\'t find any result. Also, if the largest array (`nums[-1]`) multiplied by `N` would be less than `target`, we can\\\\\\'t find any solution. So, `break`. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor other cases, we run the `helper` function again with new inputs, and we keep doing it until we get to `N=2` in which we use `twoSum` function, and add the results to get the final output. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def fourSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\n        nums.sort()\\\\n        results = []\\\\n        self.helper(nums, target, 4, [], results)\\\\n        return results\\\\n    \\\\n    def helper(self, nums, target, N, res, results):\\\\n        \\\\n        if len(nums) < N or N < 2: #1\\\\n            return\\\\n        if N == 2: #2\\\\n            output_2sum = self.twoSum(nums, target)\\\\n            if output_2sum != []:\\\\n                for idx in output_2sum:\\\\n                    results.append(res + idx)\\\\n        \\\\n        else: \\\\n            for i in range(len(nums) -N +1): #3\\\\n                if nums[i]*N > target or nums[-1]*N < target: #4\\\\n                    break\\\\n                if i == 0 or i > 0 and nums[i-1] != nums[i]: #5\\\\n                    self.helper(nums[i+1:], target-nums[i], N-1, res + [nums[i]], results)\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        left = 0\\\\n        right = len(nums) - 1 \\\\n        while left < right: \\\\n            temp_sum = nums[left] + nums[right] \\\\n\\\\n            if temp_sum == target:\\\\n                res.append([nums[left], nums[right]])\\\\n                right -= 1\\\\n                left += 1\\\\n                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:\\\\n                    left += 1\\\\n                while right > left and nums[right] == nums[right + 1]:\\\\n                    right -= 1\\\\n                                \\\\n            elif temp_sum < target: \\\\n                left +=1 \\\\n            else: \\\\n                right -= 1\\\\n                                        \\\\n        return res\\\\n```\\\\n[**Combination Sum II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t post combination sum here since it\\\\\\'s basically this problem a little bit easier. \\\\nCombination questions can be solved with `dfs` most of the time. if you want to fully understand this concept and [backtracking](https://www.***.org/backtracking-introduction/), try to finish [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/discuss/429538/General-Backtracking-questions-solutions-in-Python-for-reference-%3A) post and do all the examples. \\\\n\\\\nRead my older post first [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/discuss/729397/python3-solution-with-detailed-explanation). This should give you a better idea of what\\\\\\'s going on. The solution here also follow the exact same format except for some minor changes. I first made a minor change in the `dfs` function where it doesn\\\\\\'t need the `index` parameter anymore. This is taken care of by `candidates[i+1:]` in line `#3`. Note that we had `candidates` here in the previous post. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution(object):\\\\n    def combinationSum2(self, candidates, target):\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        :type candidates: List[int]\\\\n        :type target: int\\\\n        :rtype: List[List[int]]\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        candidates.sort()\\\\n        self.dfs(candidates, target, [], res)\\\\n        return res\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    def dfs(self, candidates, target, path, res):\\\\n        if target < 0:\\\\n            return\\\\n        \\\\n        if target == 0:\\\\n            res.append(path)\\\\n            return res\\\\n        \\\\n        for i in range(len(candidates)):\\\\n            if i > 0 and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]: #1\\\\n                continue #2\\\\n            self.dfs(candidates[i+1:], target - candidates[i], path+[candidates[i]], res) #3\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe only differences are lines `#1, 2, 3`. The difference in problem statement in this one and `combinations` problem of my previous post is >>>candidates must be used once<<< and lines `#1` and `2` are here to take care of this.  Line `#1` has two components where first `i > 0` and second `candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]`. The second component `candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]` is to take care of duplicates in the `candidates` variable as was instructed in the problem statement. Basically, if the next number in `candidates` is the same as the previous one, it means that it has already been taken care of, so `continue`. The first component takes care of cases like an input  `candidates = [1]` with `target = 1` (try to remove this component and submit your solution. You\\\\\\'ll see what I mean). The rest is similar to the previous [post](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/discuss/729397/python3-solution-with-detailed-explanation)\\\\n\\\\n================================================================\\\\nFinal note: Please let me know if you found any typo/error/ect.

       "    'content': '# First solution using Brute Force\\\\n\\\\n## Approach\\\\n\\\\nThe approach used in this solution is a brute force approach which involves iterating through each element of the array and checking if there is another element in the array that can be added to it to get the target value.\\\\n\\\\nThe function starts by getting the length of the input array. It then iterates through each element of the array using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the array from the first element to the second last element. The inner loop iterates through the array from the next element after the current outer loop index to the last element of the array.\\\\n\\\\nFor each iteration of the inner loop, the function checks if the sum of the current element and the element pointed to by the inner loop index is equal to the target value. If it is, the function returns an array of the two indices.\\\\n\\\\nIf no two elements in the array add up to the target value, the function returns an empty array.\\\\n\\\\n## Complexity\\\\n\\\\nAlthough this approach is simple and easy to understand, it has a *time complexity* of $$O(n^2)$$ which is not very efficient for large input arrays.\\\\n\\\\nThe *space complexity* of the function is $$O(1)$$.\\\\n\\\\n## Code\\\\n```swift\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {\\\\n        let n = nums.count\\\\n\\\\n        for i in 0 ..< n {\\\\n            for j in i + 1 ..< n {\\\\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target {\\\\n                    return [i, j]\\\\n                }\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n    \\\\n        return []\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# Second solution using Dictionary\\\\n\\\\n## Approach\\\\n\\\\nThis approach to solving the problem uses a dictionary to keep track of the difference between the target and each element in the input array. \\\\n\\\\nThe function first initializes an empty dictionary called `dict`. \\\\n\\\\nThen, it loops through the array using the `enumerated()` method to get both the `index` and `value` of each element in the array. For each element, it checks if the difference between the `target` and the element is already in the dictionary. If it is, that means the current element plus the element at the index in the dictionary adds up to the `target`, so it returns the indices of those two elements. If the difference is not in the dictionary, it adds the difference as a key and the `index` as a value to the dictionary. \\\\n\\\\nIf the loop is completed and no two elements in the array add up to the target, the function returns an empty array. \\\\n\\\\n## Complexity\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this approach has a time complexity of $$O(n)$$ because it only needs to loop through the array once, and a space complexity of $$O(n)$$ because it needs to store the dictionary.\\\\n\\\\n## Code\\\\n```swift\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {\\\\n        var dict = [Int: Int]()\\\\n        \\\\n        for (index, value) in nums.enumerated() {\\\\n            if let addent = dict[value] {\\\\n                return [addent, index]\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                dict[target - value] = index\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        return []\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# Third solution using Two Pointer\\\\n\\\\n## Approach\\\\n\\\\nThe approach used in this solution is a two-pointer approach. The given array of integers `nums` is first sorted in ascending order in the line `let sortedNums = nums.sorted()`.\\\\n\\\\nAfter sorting, two pointers `left` and `right` are initialized at the beginning and end of the sorted array respectively. The pointers are then moved inward from both ends towards the middle of the array while checking whether the sum of the values at these pointers is equal to the target value.\\\\n\\\\nIf the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers is equal to the `target` value, the indices of these values in the initial unsorted array are returned. If the sum is less than the `target` value, the `left` pointer is moved one step to the `right`. If the sum is greater than the `target` value, the `right` pointer is moved one step to the `left`.\\\\n\\\\nThis process of incrementing and decrementing the pointers continues until the sum of the values at the pointers is equal to the `target` value, or the pointers meet in the middle and there are no more values to check.\\\\n\\\\n## Complexity\\\\n\\\\nThe time complexity of this approach is $$O(n^2)$$.\\\\n\\\\nThe space complexity is $$O(n)$$ due to the creation of a new sorted array.\\\\n\\\\n## Code\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {\\\\n        let sortedNums = nums.sorted()\\\\n        var left = 0\\\\n        var right = nums.count - 1\\\\n\\\\n        while left < right {\\\\n            let sum = sortedNums[left] + sortedNums[right]\\\\n            if sum == target {\\\\n                if let index1 = nums.firstIndex(of: sortedNums[left]),\\\\n                   let index2 = nums.lastIndex(of: sortedNums[right]) {\\\\n                return [index1, index2]\\\\n                }\\\\n            } else if sum < target {\\\\n                left += 1\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                right -= 1\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\n        return []\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Upvote ^^\\\\n\\\\n![upvote.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0a04c379-6f12-48d1-8ee4-6bca3f1294ea_1681555786.816697.png)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n',\n",

These are their differences and the order of when they\\\\'ll be processed:\\\\n```\\\\n1. 9 - 2 = 7\\\\n2. 9 - 7 = 2\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFirst processed is `9 - 2`. Since difference is `7`, check if there is an element with key `7` in the map. In this case, not yet. But store `2, 0` pair.\\\\nThe next pair that will be processed: `9 - 7`. Check for existence of 2 in the map. In this case it exists so pull out the assigned index to it and create a resulting array.\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity: O(n) - worse case, there are no pairs and we iterate over every single item; fetching items from a map is 0(1)\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity: O(n) - we are using map to store the pairs\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\\\n * @param {number} target\\\\n * @return {number[]}\\\\n */\\\\nvar twoSum = function(nums, target) {\\\\n    let mp = new Map()\\\\n    \\\\n    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\\\n        let diff = target - nums[i]\\\\n        \\\\n        if (mp.has(diff)) {\\\\n            return [i, mp.get(diff)]\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        mp.set(nums[i], i)\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\",\n",

It will be slow of course with $$O(n^2)$$ time complexity.\\\\n\\\\n##### Approach\\\\nI use nested loop.

Hash Table approach\\\\nA better solution is to use a dictionary. First thing is first, we all know retreiving elements from dictionary is lightning fast since its based on hash maps. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, imagine all numbers were actually in a dictionary instead of an array. Then, when you are traversing in the outer loop, you can just say `if (dict.contains(target - currentElement))` to see if the matching pair of the current element is in the dictionary. \\\\nBelow, you can see that logic. Read and let it sink.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nvar pairs = new Dictionary<int, int>();\\\\nfor(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\\\n    if(pairs.ContainsKey(target - nums[i]))\\\\n        return new int[] { pairs[target - nums[i]], i };\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, we dont have all the elements in the dictionary at the beginning of the traversal, so we need to keep adding elements to dictionary if its pair is not found (i.e. the task isnt over yet).\\\\nThat\\\\'s why we need an `else` block to add the element to the dict.\\\\n```\\\\n    else\\\\n        pairs.TryAdd(nums[i], i);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n##### Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n$$O(n)$$\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\n $$O(n)$$\\\\n\\\\n##### Code\\\\n```\\\\npublic class Solution \\\\n{\\\\n    public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) \\\\n    {\\\\n        var pairs = new Dictionary<int, int>();\\\\n        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\\\n            if(pairs.ContainsKey(target - nums[i]))\\\\n                return new int[] { pairs[target - nums[i]], i };\\\\n            else\\\\n                pairs.TryAdd(nums[i], i);\\\\n        \\\\n        return default;\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\",\n",

Create a class named `Solution`.\\\\n2. Declare a member function `twoSum` that takes a vector of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`target`) as parameters.\\\\n3. Declare a variable `n` and assign it the size of the `nums` vector.\\\\n4. Declare a vector of integers named `output` with two elements, initialized to 0.\\\\n5. Use a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of numbers from the `nums` vector.\\\\n6. The outer loop variable `i` will iterate from 0 to `n - 1`.\\\\n7. The inner loop variable `j` will iterate from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.\\\\n8. Check if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` equals the `target`.\\\\n9. If the condition is satisfied, update the `output` vector with the indices `i` and `j`.\\\\n10. Return the `output` vector as the solution.\\\\n11.

First we insert the first element of the array i.e. 2 into the map.\\\\n2. Now the map contain [2,0], where 2 is key and 0 is index.\\\\n3. Now we iterate the for loop from 1. So nums[i] i.e. nums[1]=5. To make the some 9 we need the element, 9-5 i.e. 4.\\\\n4. So we store in temp i.e. temp = target-nums[i] i.e. 4.\\\\n5. Now checking that is 4 present in the map. If present then push the index of it to the vector i.e. v.push_back(mp[temp]) and v.push_back(i). But the if condition does not satisfy here.\\\\n6. Else if the temp value not present in the map insert the current element with it index into the map i.e. the else statement is executed here. So after this the map will contain [[2,0], [5,1]].\\\\n7. For second ieration of the loop the element is 7 and to make sum 9 we need the element 9-7=2. Now searching that if two presented in the map and the ans is yes so if condition executed and pushing the index of element 2 to the vector and the inde of 7 also and return it.\\\\n\\\\n**Test Case 2:**\\\\n[3,3] and target = 6.\\\\n1. First we insert the first element of the array i.e. 3 into the map.\\\\n2. Now the map contain [3,0].\\\\n3. Now we iterate the for loop from 1. So nums[i] i.e. nums[1]=3. To make the some 6 we need the element, 6-3 i.e. 3.\\\\n4. So we store in temp i.e. temp = target-nums[i] i.e. 3.\\\\n5. Now checking that is 3 present in the map. Here it present so push the index of it to the vector i.e. v.push_back(mp[temp]) which will push 0 and v.push_back(i) which will push the current index 1.\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n**O(n)**\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\n**O(n)**\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        unordered_map<int,int> mp;\\\\n        vector<int> v;\\\\n        mp[nums[0]] = 0;\\\\n        for(int i=1; i<nums.size(); i++){\\\\n            int temp = target-nums[i];\\\\n            if(mp.find(temp) != mp.end()){\\\\n                v.push_back(mp[temp]);\\\\n                v.push_back(i);\\\\n                return v;\\\\n            }\\\\n            else\\\\n                mp[nums[i]] = i;\\\\n        }\\\\n        return v;\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\",\n",

       "    'content': \"Hey everyone! In this post, we\\\\'ll see the different approaches to solve this problem.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, let\\\\'s try to understand what we have to do in this problem. Given an array, we have to find if there exists any pair of distinct elements (differring in their indices) which add up to target. Formally, given an array nums, we need to return {i, j} where i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\'s first write a brute force solution (implementing what was explained above):\\\\n\\\\n**Brute force solution 1:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            /* for each element nums[i], go through the whole array\\\\n               again to see if there is an element target - nums[i] at\\\\n               an index other than i\\\\n            */\\\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\\\n                if (i != j && nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\\\\n                    // found the pair\\\\n                    return {i, j};\\\\n                }\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity  : O(n ^ 2)\\\\nSpace complexity: O(1)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nNow, let\\\\'s try to optimise the above brute force solution to make it faster. How do we do that?\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\'s make some observations. If for indices i and j, nums[i] + nums[j] != target, then we can be sure that nums[j] + nums[i] will also not be equal to target. Let me explain what I mean by this through an example:\\\\n\\\\nTake an example array `nums = [3, 4, 6]` and `target = 8`\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [3, 4, 6]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t       |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t   j\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nif `nums[i] + nums[j] != target`, then we can be sure that:\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t j\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [3, 4, 6]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t       |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t   i\\\\n```\\\\n`nums[i] + nums[j]` won\\\\'t be equal to target. So, in other words, for an element `nums[i]`, we don\\\\'t have to check for any index `j (j < i)` if `nums[i] = nums[j] == target`.\\\\n\\\\nThis would make the brute force solution faster. Let\\\\'s see it\\\\'s implementation:\\\\n\\\\n**Brute force solution 2:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\\\\n                /* since we start checking from index i+1, we don\\\\'t\\\\n                   need to do i != j check inside the if condition\\\\n                */\\\\n                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\\\\n                    return {i, j};\\\\n                }\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity  : O(n ^ 2)\\\\nSpace complexity: O(1)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nWe know that O(n ^ 2) is quite slow. So let\\\\'s try to come up with a better algorithm. To do so, let\\\\'s try to come back to the problem statement. We need to find a pair of distinct elements `nums[i] and nums[j]` which add up to `target`. So, in other words, for each element `nums[i]`, we want to see if there exists an element `target - nums[i]` in the array `nums`. If there is, then we\\\\'ve just found the pair. We can use binary search to know if the compliment element exists or not.\\\\n\\\\n```text\\\\nQuestion:\\\\nWe can find if an element exists in the array by using binary search. But what\\\\nabout the indices of the pair of elements? We have to again linearly search for\\\\nthe indices of these elements right?\\\\n\\\\nAnswer:\\\\nTrue. But there is an alternative. We can form a nested list in which each element \\\\nwould have two elements. The first one being the element itself and the other the \\\\nindex of this element. We can sort this list before doing binary search. This way, \\\\nwhen we find the correct pair, we can just directly return the indices.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Idea to implement the binary search:**\\\\n\\\\nAlthough we can implement binary search like we saw above, we can face a small issue. This issue can be seen from the following example:\\\\n\\\\nIf the array `nums = [4, 1, 2, 6]` and `target = 8`. While looking for `target - nums[0]` we get 4. If we use binary search to find it, we might end up getting the element at the same index. We don\\\\'t want this. So, to avoid this, we will limit our search space to [0, i-1]. Since, one solution is guaranteed to exist, we can be sure that our binary search will get the correct answer when we encounter the bigger number of the pair.\\\\n\\\\n**Binary search implementation:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    /* This function returns (true, index) if element is found otherwise\\\\n       it returns (false, -1)\\\\n    */\\\\n    std::pair<bool,int> binary_search(std::vector<std::pair<int,int>>& a, int ind, int key) {\\\\n        int i = 0, j = ind - 1;\\\\n        while (i <= j) {\\\\n            int m = (i + j) / 2;\\\\n            if (a[m].first == key) {\\\\n                return std::make_pair(true, a[m].second);\\\\n            } else if (a[m].first < key) {\\\\n                i = m + 1;\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                j = m - 1;\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        return std::make_pair(false, -1);\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        // Making the nested list\\\\n        std::vector<std::pair<int,int>> a {};\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            a.push_back(std::make_pair(nums[i], i));\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        // Sorting the array so that binary search can be used\\\\n        std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());\\\\n        \\\\n        // Finding the pair using binary search\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            int key = target - a[i].first;\\\\n            std::pair<bool,int> res = binary_search(a, i, key);\\\\n            \\\\n            // found the pair\\\\n            if (res.first == true) {\\\\n                return {a[i].second, res.second};\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        /* This is written to avoid the compiler warning of not returning \\\\n           anything from the function which has a return type of vector<int>\\\\n        */\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N logN)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nBinary search works much faster than the brute force solution. That being said, it wasn\\\\'t the easiest to implement.\\\\n\\\\nWe can also solve this problem using two pointers instead of binary search to find the compliment. If you don\\\\'t know how two pointers method works, I\\\\'ll try to explain it with the following example.\\\\n\\\\nConsider an sorted array `nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]` and `target = 12`\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1:** First we create two variables pointing to first and last elements of a sorted array, `i = 0` and `j = n - 1` where `n` is the size of the array nums.\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t      j\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2:** Now, check compare `nums[i] + nums[j]` with `target`. if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`, we have found the pair. If `nums[i] + nums[j] < target` we have to increase the sum and this can only be done by moving the `i` pointer forward. If `nums[i] + nums[j] > target`, then we need to decrease the sum which can only be done by decrementing `j` pointer.\\\\n\\\\nSince (1 + 10) is less than 12, we increment `i` pointer.\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t      j\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3:** Now, the array looks something like this:\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t    i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t        |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t      j\\\\n```\\\\nSince (3 + 10) is greater than 12, decrement `j` pointer.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4:** Now the array looks like:\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t    i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t        |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  j\\\\n```\\\\nNow, (3 + 9) is equal to 12. So, we have found the pair.\\\\n\\\\nThis is how the concept of two pointers work. I hope you understood it. If something is still unclear, I suggest you to take an example array of your own (remember to sort it) and follow the steps explained above and it\\\\'ll be clear in no time :)\\\\n\\\\nNow, similar to binary search implementation, we need to have a nested list with values and indices so that when we get such a valid pair, we can immediately output the indices without having to again find the indices individually.\\\\n\\\\n**Two Pointers implementation:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        // making the nested list\\\\n        std::vector<std::pair<int,int>> a {};\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            a.push_back(std::make_pair(nums[i], i));\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        // sorting the list\\\\n        std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());\\\\n        \\\\n        // using two pointers approach to find the pair\\\\n        int i = 0, j = n - 1;\\\\n        while (i < j) {\\\\n            int sum = a[i].first + a[j].first;\\\\n            if (sum == target) {\\\\n                // found pair so return answer\\\\n                return {a[i].second, a[j].second};\\\\n            } else if (sum < target) {\\\\n                i++;\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                j--;\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        /* This is just to avoid the compiler warning of not returning anything from\\\\n           a function with a return type of vector<int>\\\\n        */\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N logN)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nNow let\\\\'s try to optimise the search for the compliment (target - nums[i]) even more. Since we know that an unordered_map has constant O(1) insertion, deletion and look-up on average, we can use it to our advantage. We can instantly check if the compliment element exists in the array.\\\\n\\\\n```text\\\\nQuestion 1:\\\\nBut what if target is twice an element in nums[i]. There is a possibility that we \\\\nend up finding the element at the same index if it occurs only once.\\\\nfor eg: nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 4;\\\\n\\\\nAnswer 1:\\\\nSo, to avoid this issue, we\\\\'ll only be looking at elements which are already in the \\\\nunordered_map like we did in binary search. So, for ith element, we\\\\'ll be \\\\nchecking if target - nums[i] exists in the map. Since we know that a pair is \\\\nguarenteed to exist, we\\\\'ll get it when we encounter the second element of that \\\\nvalid pair in the array.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQuestion 2:\\\\nBut what if there are multiple occurrences of same element which add up to \\\\ntarget? How will we store their indices to get distinct indices? \\\\nfor eg: nums = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 4\\\\n\\\\nAnswer:\\\\nIt still wouldn\\\\'t be a problem. Just update the value of that key to the latest \\\\nindex. If there are multiple occurrences of that element and they add up to \\\\ntarget, then we will find the pair when we encounter the first occurrence of \\\\nthat element.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation using unordered_map:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        std::unordered_map<int,int> m;\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)nums.size(); i++) {\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t    // checking if target - nums[i] already exists in the map\\\\n            if (m.count(target - nums[i])) {\\\\n                return {i, m[target - nums[i]]};\\\\n            }\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t// if it does not, then just update the map with the current element\\\\n            m[nums[i]] = i;\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t/* This is just to avoid the compiler warning of not returning anything\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t    from a function with a return type of vector<int>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t*/\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** We can also use a `std::map` instead of `std::unordered_map` in the same implementation. Although the operations of look-up, insertion and deletion take O(log N) time in `std::map`, in practice it\\\\'s safer to use `std::map` over `std::unordered_map` even if it takes extra time sometimes. This is because it\\\\'s quite possible for `std::unordered_map` to have unusually high collisions for a given input making it very very slow.\\\\n\\\\nFor `std::map` implementation of above code:\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N logN)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n***Thanks for reading the article.

Thus we can trim down the time complexity of the problem.\\\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\\\n\\\\n# Approach\\\\nThe steps are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n1. We will select the element of the array one by one using a loop(say i).\\\\n2. Then we will check if the other required element(i.e. target-arr[i]) exists in the hashMap.\\\\nIf that element exists, then we will return \\\\u201CYES\\\\u201D for the first variant or we will return the current index i.e. i, and the index of the element found using map i.e. mp[target-arr[i]].\\\\nIf that element does not exist, then we will just store the current element in the hashMap along with its index. Because in the future, the current element might be a part of our answer.\\\\n3. Finally, if we are out of the loop, that means there is no such pair whose sum is equal to the target.

       "    'content': \"# Intuition\\\\nThe problem is asking us to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value. One straightforward approach is to use a nested loop to check every possible pair of numbers and see if their sum is equal to the target value. However, this would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not very efficient for large input arrays.\\\\n\\\\n# Approach\\\\nA better approach is to use a hash table to store the index of each number in the array as we loop through it. For each number, we calculate its complement (i.e. the value that would add up to the target value if added to the current number) and check if it\\\\'s already in the hash table. If it is, then we\\\\'ve found the pair of numbers that add up to the target value. If it\\\\'s not, then we add the current number and its index to the hash table and continue looping.\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n- Time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums  \\\\nThis is because we are looping through the array once and doing constant-time operations for each element.\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\n- Space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums\\\\nThis is because we are using a hash map to store the index of each element, and the worst-case scenario is when all the elements are unique, so the hash map would have to store all n elements\\\\n\\\\nI have tried this problem in each approach\\\\n# Code\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\\\n * @param {number} target\\\\n * @return {number[]}\\\\n */\\\\n\\\\nfunction twoSum(nums, target) {\\\\n  const map = new Map();\\\\n  \\\\n  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\\\n    const x = target - nums[i];\\\\n    \\\\n    if (map.has(x)) {\\\\n      return [map.get(x), i];\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    map.set(nums[i], i);\\\\n  }\\\\n  \\\\n  return [];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n// const twoSum = function(nums, target) {\\\\n//     let index =[];\\\\n//     for (let i=0; i<nums.length-1; i++){\\\\n//         for (let j=i+1; j<nums.length; j++){\\\\n//             if(nums[i] + nums[j] === target){\\\\n//                 index.push(i);\\\\n//                 index.push(j);\\\\n//                 //  index =[i, j];\\\\n//             }\\\\n//         }\\\\n//     }\\\\n//     return index;\\\\n// };\\\\n\\\\n// const twoSum =(nums, target)=>{\\\\n//     //nums=nums.sort()\\\\n//     let left =0;\\\\n//     let right = nums.length-1;\\\\n\\\\n//     while(left<right){\\\\n//        let sum = nums[left]+ nums[right];\\\\n\\\\n//     if(sum == target) return [left,right]\\\\n//     if(sum< target) left++;\\\\n//     if(sum> target) right--;\\\\n\\\\n//     }\\\\n// }\\\\n\\\\n// function twoSum(a,b){\\\\n//     // let idx=[];\\\\n//     for(let i=0; i<a.length; i++){\\\\n//         for(let j=i+1; j<a.length; j++){\\\\n//             if(a[i]+a[j]=== b){\\\\n//                 idx =[i,j]\\\\n//             }\\\\n//         }\\\\n//     }\\\\n//     return idx;\\\\n// }\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n//  var twoSum = function (nums, target) {\\\\n//      for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){\\\\n//          for(let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++){\\\\n//              if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target){\\\\n//                  return [i,j]\\\\n//              }\\\\n//          }\\\\n//      }\\\\n//  }\\\\n```\",\n",

       "    'content': '# Intuition\\\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\\\nThe Two Sum problem asks us to find two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. We need to return the indices of these two numbers.\\\\n# Approach\\\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\\\n1. One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target. This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).\\\\n2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table.\\\\n\\\\n**Approach using a hash table:**\\\\n1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.\\\\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\\\\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].\\\\n4. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.\\\\n5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash table with its index as the value.\\\\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.\\\\n7. If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) since hash table lookups take constant time on average. It allows us to solve the Two Sum problem efficiently by making just one pass through the array.\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n# Solution 1: (Brute Force)\\\\n```C++ []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        for (int i = 0;

The outer loop runs from 0 to len(nums)-1, and the inner loop runs from i+1 to len(nums)-1, where i is the current index of the outer loop. Within the nested loops, constant time operations are performed, such as checking if the sum of two numbers equals the target, appending indices to the a list, and using break and continue statements.\\\\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n^2) due to the nested loops.\\\\n\\\\nMethod 2: \\\\nThe code uses one loop to iterate over the number and subtract from target and if that subtracted number is present in list then return the index of both number. \\\\n(here if condition of a==i means that possibly the target is 10 and present number in list might be [5,5] but it will return the same index so we need to skip)\\\\n\\\\nMethod 3: \\\\nThe dictionary will help us to find the complement of each number more efficiently. In Method 2, Change the loop variable from i to num using the enumerate() function. This allows us to directly access the numbers from the nums list instead of using indexing.\\\\nReplaced the variable p with complement to improve code readability.\\\\nReplaced if p in nums with if complement in num_dict. This change allows us to check if the complement exists in the num_dict dictionary, which provides a more efficient lookup compared to the in operator on a list.\\\\nModified the return statement to return [num_dict[complement], i] instead of i, a. This returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, as required.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n\\\\nMethod 1: \\\\nO(n^2) due to nested loops\\\\n\\\\nMethod 2: \\\\nO(n^2) because the the code uses a single loop that iterates over each element in the nums list which takes O(n) and index() method is called within the loop which takes O(n) time in the worst case to call the index of element.\\\\n\\\\nMethod 3: \\\\n**O(n)**  The use of the dictionary (num_dict) allows for efficient lookup of complements in constant time, improving the overall time complexity to O(n) compared to the previous methods with a time complexity of O(n^2) when using the brute force and index() method.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\nthe space complexity of the code is O(1) in all 3 methods.\\\\n\\\\n$$PLEASE$$ $$UPVOTE$$\\\\n# Code\\\\n\\\\nMethod 1: \\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        a=[]\\\\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\\\\n            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):\\\\n                if (nums[i]+nums[j]==target):\\\\n                    a.append(i)\\\\n                    a.append(j)\\\\n                    break\\\\n                else:\\\\n                    continue        \\\\n        return a\\\\n```\\\\nMethod 2:\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        a=0\\\\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\\\\n            p = target-nums[i]\\\\n            if p in nums:\\\\n                a=nums.index(p)\\\\n                if a==i:\\\\n                    continue\\\\n                break\\\\n        return i,a\\\\n```\\\\nMethod 3:\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        num_dict = {}\\\\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\\\n            complement = target - num\\\\n            if complement in num_dict:\\\\n                return [num_dict[complement], i]\\\\n            num_dict[num] = i\\\\n        return []\\\\n```',\n",

If it is, we have found a pair that adds up to the target.\\\\n\\\\n# Approach\\\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\\\n1 Create an empty hash map.\\\\n2 Iterate over the array and for each element:\\\\n1.1 Calculate the complement by subtracting the element from the target.\\\\n1.2 Check if the complement exists in the hash map.\\\\n1.3 If the complement exists, return the indices of the current element and the complement.\\\\n1.4 If the complement does not exist, add the element and its index to the hash map.\\\\n3 If no pair is found, return null or an empty result.\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:O(n)\\\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:O(n)\\\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\\\nTime complexity: Where n is the length of the input array. We need to traverse the array once to find the pair.\\\\nSpace complexity: Where n is the length of the input array. In the worst case, we need to store all the elements in the hash table.\\\\n\\\\n```Java []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\\\\n        Map < Integer, Integer > seen = new HashMap < > ();\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\\\n            int complement = target - nums[i];\\\\n            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {\\\\n                return new int[] {\\\\n                    seen.get(complement), i\\\\n                };\\\\n            }\\\\n            seen.put(nums[i], i);\\\\n        }\\\\n        return null; // No solution found\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n```Python []\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        hash_map = {}\\\\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\\\n            complement = target - num\\\\n            if complement in hash_map:\\\\n                return [hash_map[complement], i]\\\\n            hash_map[num] = i\\\\n        return []\\\\n```\\\\n```C++ []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        unordered_map<int, int> map;\\\\n        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){\\\\n            int complement = target - nums[i];\\\\n            if(map.find(complement) != map.end()){\\\\n                return {map[complement], i};\\\\n            }\\\\n            \\\\n            map[nums[i]] = i;\\\\n        }\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n```C# []\\\\nusing System;\\\\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\\\\n\\\\npublic class Solution {\\\\n    public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\\\\n        Dictionary<int, int> map = new Dictionary<int, int>();\\\\n        \\\\n        for(int i=0; i<nums.Length; i++){\\\\n            int complement = target - nums[i];\\\\n            if(map.ContainsKey(complement)){\\\\n                return new int[] {map[complement], i};\\\\n            }\\\\n            \\\\n            map[nums[i]] = i;\\\\n        }\\\\n        return new int[0];\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n```JavaScript []\\\\nvar twoSum = function(nums, target) {\\\\n    const map = new Map();\\\\n    for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){\\\\n        const complement = target - nums[i];\\\\n        if(map.has(complement))\\\\n            return [map.get(complement), i];\\\\n        map.set(nums[i], i);\\\\n    }\\\\n    return [];\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'If you\\\\\\'re a newbie and sometimes have a hard time understanding the logic. Don\\\\\\'t worry, you\\\\\\'ll catch up after a month of doing Leetcode on a daily basis. Try to do it, even one example per day. It\\\\\\'d help. I\\\\\\'ve compiled a bunch on `sum` problems here, go ahead and check it out. Also, I think focusing on a subject and do 3-4 problems would help to get the idea behind solution since they mostly follow the same logic. Of course there are other ways to solve each problems but I try to be as uniform as possible. Good luck. \\\\n\\\\nIn general, `sum` problems can be categorized into two categories: 1) there is any array and you add some numbers to get to (or close to) a `target`, or 2) you need to return indices of numbers that sum up to a (or close to) a `target` value.  Note that when the problem is looking for a indices, `sort`ing the array is probably NOT a good idea. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n **[Two Sum:](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**  \\\\n \\\\n This is the second type of the problems where we\\\\\\'re looking for indices, so sorting is not necessary. What you\\\\\\'d want to do is to go over the array, and try to find two integers that sum up to  a `target` value. Most of the times, in such a problem, using dictionary (hastable) helps. You try to keep track of you\\\\\\'ve observations in a dictionary and use it once you get to the results. \\\\n\\\\nNote: try to be comfortable to use `enumerate` as it\\\\\\'s sometime out of comfort zone for newbies. `enumerate` comes handy in a lot of problems (I mean if you want to have a cleaner code of course). If I had to choose three built in functions/methods that I wasn\\\\\\'t comfortable with at the start and have found them super helpful, I\\\\\\'d probably say `enumerate`, `zip` and `set`. \\\\n \\\\nSolution: In this problem, you initialize a dictionary (`seen`). This dictionary will keep track of numbers (as `key`) and indices (as `value`). So, you go over your array (line `#1`) using `enumerate` that gives you both index and value of elements in array. As an example, let\\\\\\'s do `nums = [2,3,1]` and `target = 3`. Let\\\\\\'s say you\\\\\\'re at index `i = 0` and `value = 2`, ok? you need to find `value = 1` to finish the problem, meaning, `target - 2 = 1`. 1 here is the `remaining`. Since `remaining + value = target`, you\\\\\\'re done once you found it, right? So when going through the array, you calculate the `remaining` and check to see whether `remaining` is in the `seen` dictionary (line `#3`). If it is, you\\\\\\'re done! you\\\\\\'re current number and the remaining from `seen` would give you the output (line `#4`). Otherwise, you add your current number to the dictionary (line `#5`) since it\\\\\\'s going to be a `remaining` for (probably) a number you\\\\\\'ll see in the future assuming that there is at least one instance of answer.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n ```\\\\n class Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        seen = {}\\\\n        for i, value in enumerate(nums): #1\\\\n            remaining = target - nums[i] #2\\\\n            \\\\n            if remaining in seen: #3\\\\n                return [i, seen[remaining]]  #4\\\\n            else:\\\\n                seen[value] = i  #5\\\\n```\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n **[Two Sum II:](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)**  \\\\n\\\\nFor this, you can do exactly as the previous. The only change I made below was to change the order of line `#4`. In the previous example, the order didn\\\\\\'t matter. But, here the problem asks for asending order and since the values/indicess in `seen` has always lower indices than your current number, it should come first.  Also, note that the problem says it\\\\\\'s not zero based, meaning that indices don\\\\\\'t start from zero, that\\\\\\'s why I added 1 to both of them. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        \\\\n        seen = {}\\\\n        for i, value in enumerate(numbers): \\\\n            remaining = target - numbers[i] \\\\n           \\\\n            if remaining in seen: \\\\n                return [seen[remaining]+1, i+1]  #4\\\\n            else:\\\\n                seen[value] = i  \\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAnother approach to solve this problem (probably what Leetcode is looking for) is to treat it as first category of problems. Since the array is already sorted, this works. You see the following approach in a lot of problems. What you want to do is to have two pointer (if it was 3sum, you\\\\\\'d need three pointers as you\\\\\\'ll see in the future examples). One pointer move from `left` and one from `right`. Let\\\\\\'s say you `numbers = [1,3,6,9]` and your `target = 10`. Now, `left` points to 1 at first, and  `right` points to 9. There are three possibilities. If you sum numbers that `left` and `right` are pointing at, you get `temp_sum` (line `#1`). If `temp_sum` is your target, you\\\\\\'r done! You\\\\\\'re return it (line `#9`). If it\\\\\\'s more than your `target`, it means that `right` is poiting to a very large value (line `#5`) and you need to bring it a little bit to the left to a smaller (r maybe equal) value (line `#6`)  by adding one to the index . If the `temp_sum` is less than `target` (line `#7`), then you need to move your `left` to a little bit larger value by adding one to the index (line `#9`). This way, you try to narrow down the range in which you\\\\\\'re looking at and will eventually find a couple of number that sum to `target`, then, you\\\\\\'ll return this in line `#9`. In this problem, since it says there is only one solution, nothing extra is necessary. However, when a problem asks to return all combinations that sum to `target`, you can\\\\\\'t simply return the first instace and you need to collect all the possibilities and return the list altogether (you\\\\\\'ll see something like this in the next example). \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        \\\\n        for left in range(len(numbers) -1): #1\\\\n            right = len(numbers) - 1 #2\\\\n            while left < right: #3\\\\n                temp_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right] #4\\\\n                if temp_sum > target:  #5\\\\n                    right -= 1 #6\\\\n                elif temp_sum < target: #7\\\\n                    left +=1 #8\\\\n                else:\\\\n                    return [left+1, right+1] #9\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[**3Sum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)\\\\n\\\\nThis is similar to the previous example except that it\\\\\\'s looking for three numbers. There are some minor differences in the problem statement. It\\\\\\'s looking for all combinations (not just one) of solutions returned as a list. And second, it\\\\\\'s looking for unique combination, repeatation is not allowed. \\\\n\\\\nHere, instead of looping (line `#1`) to `len(nums) -1`, we loop to `len(nums) -2` since we\\\\\\'re looking for three numbers. Since we\\\\\\'re returning values, `sort` would be a good idea. Otherwise, if the `nums` is not sorted, you cannot reducing `right` pointer or increasing `left` pointer easily, makes sense? \\\\n\\\\nSo, first you `sort` the array and define `res = []` to collect your outputs. In line `#2`, we check wether two consecutive elements are equal or not because if they are, we don\\\\\\'t want them (solutions need to be unique) and will skip to the next set of numbers. Also, there is an additional constrain in this line that `i > 0`. This is added to take care of cases like `nums = [1,1,1]` and `target = 3`. If we didn\\\\\\'t have `i > 0`, then we\\\\\\'d skip the only correct solution and would return `[]` as our answer which is wrong (correct answer is `[[1,1,1]]`.  \\\\n\\\\nWe define two additional pointers this time, `left = i + 1` and `right = len(nums) - 1`. For example, if `nums = [-2,-1,0,1,2]`, all the points in the case of `i=1` are looking at: `i` at `-1`, `left` at `0` and `right` at `2`. We then check `temp` variable similar to the previous example. There is only one change with respect to the previous example here between lines `#5` and `#10`.  If we have the `temp = target`, we obviously add this set to the `res` in line `#5`, right? However, we\\\\\\'re not done yet. For a fixed `i`, we still need to check and see whether there are other combinations by just changing `left` and `right` pointers. That\\\\\\'s what we are doing in lines `#6, 7, 8`. If we still have the condition of `left < right` and `nums[left]` and the number to the right of it are not the same, we move `left` one index to right (line `#6`). Similarly, if `nums[right]` and the value to left of it is not the same, we move `right` one index to left. This way for a fixed `i`, we get rid of repeative cases. For example, if `nums = [-3, 1,1, 3,5]` and `target = 3`, one we get the first `[-3,1,5]`, `left = 1`, but, `nums[2]` is also 1 which we don\\\\\\'t want the `left` variable to look at it simply because it\\\\\\'d again return `[-3,1,5]`, right? So, we move `left` one index. Finally, if the repeating elements don\\\\\\'t exists, lines `#6` to `#8` won\\\\\\'t get activated. In this case we still need to move forward by adding 1 to `left` and extracting 1 from `right` (lines `#9, 10`). \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\n        \\\\n        nums.sort()\\\\n        res = []\\\\n\\\\n        for i in range(len(nums) -2): #1\\\\n            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: #2\\\\n                continue\\\\n            left = i + 1 #3\\\\n            right = len(nums) - 1 #4\\\\n            \\\\n            while left < right:  \\\\n                temp = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]\\\\n                                    \\\\n                if temp > 0:\\\\n                    right -= 1\\\\n                    \\\\n                elif temp < 0:\\\\n                    left += 1\\\\n                \\\\n                else:\\\\n                    res.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]) #5\\\\n                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]: #6\\\\n                        left += 1\\\\n                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right-1]:#7\\\\n                        right -= 1    #8\\\\n                \\\\n                    right -= 1 #9 \\\\n                    left += 1 #10\\\\n                       \\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAnother way to solve this problem is to change it into a two sum problem. Instead of finding `a+b+c = 0`, you can find `a+b = -c` where we want to find two numbers `a` and `b` that are equal to `-c`, right? This is similar to the first problem. Remember if you wanted to use the exact same as the first code, it\\\\\\'d return indices and not numbers. Also, we need to re-arrage this problem in a way that we have `nums` and `target`. This code is not a good code and can be optimipized but you got the idea. For a better version of this, check [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/discuss/7384/My-Python-solution-based-on-2-sum-200-ms-beat-93.37). \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        nums.sort()\\\\n        \\\\n        for i in range(len(nums)-2):\\\\n            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\\\\n                continue\\\\n            output_2sum = self.twoSum(nums[i+1:], -nums[i])\\\\n            if output_2sum ==[]:\\\\n                continue\\\\n            else:\\\\n                for idx in output_2sum:\\\\n                    instance = idx+[nums[i]]\\\\n                    res.append(instance)\\\\n        \\\\n        output = []\\\\n        for idx in res:\\\\n            if idx not in output:\\\\n                output.append(idx)\\\\n                \\\\n        \\\\n        return output\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums, target):\\\\n        seen = {}\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        for i, value in enumerate(nums): #1\\\\n            remaining = target - nums[i] #2\\\\n           \\\\n            if remaining in seen: #3\\\\n                res.append([value, remaining])  #4\\\\n            else:\\\\n                seen[value] = i  #5\\\\n            \\\\n        return res\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[**4Sum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)\\\\n\\\\nYou should have gotten the idea, and what you\\\\\\'ve seen so far can be generalized to `nSum`. Here, I write the generic code using the same ideas as before. What I\\\\\\'ll do is to break down each case to a `2Sum II` problem, and solve them recursively using the approach in `2Sum II` example above. \\\\n\\\\nFirst sort `nums`, then I\\\\\\'m using two extra functions, `helper` and `twoSum`. The `twoSum` is similar to the `2sum II` example with some modifications. It doesn\\\\\\'t return the first instance of results, it check every possible combinations and return all of them now. Basically, now it\\\\\\'s more similar to the `3Sum` solution. Understanding this function shouldn\\\\\\'t be difficult as it\\\\\\'s very similar to `3Sum`. As for `helper` function, it first tries to check for cases that don\\\\\\'t work (line `#1`). And later, if the `N` we need to sum to get to a `target` is 2 (line `#2`), then runs the `twoSum` function. For the more than two numbers, it recursively breaks them down to two sum (line `#3`). There are some cases like line `#4` that we don\\\\\\'t need to proceed with the algorithm anymore and we can `break`. These cases include if multiplying the lowest number in the list by `N` is more than `target`. Since its sorted array, if this happens, we can\\\\\\'t find any result. Also, if the largest array (`nums[-1]`) multiplied by `N` would be less than `target`, we can\\\\\\'t find any solution. So, `break`. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor other cases, we run the `helper` function again with new inputs, and we keep doing it until we get to `N=2` in which we use `twoSum` function, and add the results to get the final output. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\n    def fourSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\n        nums.sort()\\\\n        results = []\\\\n        self.helper(nums, target, 4, [], results)\\\\n        return results\\\\n    \\\\n    def helper(self, nums, target, N, res, results):\\\\n        \\\\n        if len(nums) < N or N < 2: #1\\\\n            return\\\\n        if N == 2: #2\\\\n            output_2sum = self.twoSum(nums, target)\\\\n            if output_2sum != []:\\\\n                for idx in output_2sum:\\\\n                    results.append(res + idx)\\\\n        \\\\n        else: \\\\n            for i in range(len(nums) -N +1): #3\\\\n                if nums[i]*N > target or nums[-1]*N < target: #4\\\\n                    break\\\\n                if i == 0 or i > 0 and nums[i-1] != nums[i]: #5\\\\n                    self.helper(nums[i+1:], target-nums[i], N-1, res + [nums[i]], results)\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        left = 0\\\\n        right = len(nums) - 1 \\\\n        while left < right: \\\\n            temp_sum = nums[left] + nums[right] \\\\n\\\\n            if temp_sum == target:\\\\n                res.append([nums[left], nums[right]])\\\\n                right -= 1\\\\n                left += 1\\\\n                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:\\\\n                    left += 1\\\\n                while right > left and nums[right] == nums[right + 1]:\\\\n                    right -= 1\\\\n                                \\\\n            elif temp_sum < target: \\\\n                left +=1 \\\\n            else: \\\\n                right -= 1\\\\n                                        \\\\n        return res\\\\n```\\\\n[**Combination Sum II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t post combination sum here since it\\\\\\'s basically this problem a little bit easier. \\\\nCombination questions can be solved with `dfs` most of the time. if you want to fully understand this concept and [backtracking](https://www.***.org/backtracking-introduction/), try to finish [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/discuss/429538/General-Backtracking-questions-solutions-in-Python-for-reference-%3A) post and do all the examples. \\\\n\\\\nRead my older post first [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/discuss/729397/python3-solution-with-detailed-explanation). This should give you a better idea of what\\\\\\'s going on. The solution here also follow the exact same format except for some minor changes. I first made a minor change in the `dfs` function where it doesn\\\\\\'t need the `index` parameter anymore. This is taken care of by `candidates[i+1:]` in line `#3`. Note that we had `candidates` here in the previous post. \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution(object):\\\\n    def combinationSum2(self, candidates, target):\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        :type candidates: List[int]\\\\n        :type target: int\\\\n        :rtype: List[List[int]]\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        res = []\\\\n        candidates.sort()\\\\n        self.dfs(candidates, target, [], res)\\\\n        return res\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    def dfs(self, candidates, target, path, res):\\\\n        if target < 0:\\\\n            return\\\\n        \\\\n        if target == 0:\\\\n            res.append(path)\\\\n            return res\\\\n        \\\\n        for i in range(len(candidates)):\\\\n            if i > 0 and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]: #1\\\\n                continue #2\\\\n            self.dfs(candidates[i+1:], target - candidates[i], path+[candidates[i]], res) #3\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe only differences are lines `#1, 2, 3`. The difference in problem statement in this one and `combinations` problem of my previous post is >>>candidates must be used once<<< and lines `#1` and `2` are here to take care of this.  Line `#1` has two components where first `i > 0` and second `candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]`. The second component `candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]` is to take care of duplicates in the `candidates` variable as was instructed in the problem statement. Basically, if the next number in `candidates` is the same as the previous one, it means that it has already been taken care of, so `continue`. The first component takes care of cases like an input  `candidates = [1]` with `target = 1` (try to remove this component and submit your solution. You\\\\\\'ll see what I mean). The rest is similar to the previous [post](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/discuss/729397/python3-solution-with-detailed-explanation)\\\\n\\\\n================================================================\\\\nFinal note: Please let me know if you found any typo/error/ect.

       "    'content': '# First solution using Brute Force\\\\n\\\\n## Approach\\\\n\\\\nThe approach used in this solution is a brute force approach which involves iterating through each element of the array and checking if there is another element in the array that can be added to it to get the target value.\\\\n\\\\nThe function starts by getting the length of the input array. It then iterates through each element of the array using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the array from the first element to the second last element. The inner loop iterates through the array from the next element after the current outer loop index to the last element of the array.\\\\n\\\\nFor each iteration of the inner loop, the function checks if the sum of the current element and the element pointed to by the inner loop index is equal to the target value. If it is, the function returns an array of the two indices.\\\\n\\\\nIf no two elements in the array add up to the target value, the function returns an empty array.\\\\n\\\\n## Complexity\\\\n\\\\nAlthough this approach is simple and easy to understand, it has a *time complexity* of $$O(n^2)$$ which is not very efficient for large input arrays.\\\\n\\\\nThe *space complexity* of the function is $$O(1)$$.\\\\n\\\\n## Code\\\\n```swift\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {\\\\n        let n = nums.count\\\\n\\\\n        for i in 0 ..< n {\\\\n            for j in i + 1 ..< n {\\\\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target {\\\\n                    return [i, j]\\\\n                }\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n    \\\\n        return []\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# Second solution using Dictionary\\\\n\\\\n## Approach\\\\n\\\\nThis approach to solving the problem uses a dictionary to keep track of the difference between the target and each element in the input array. \\\\n\\\\nThe function first initializes an empty dictionary called `dict`. \\\\n\\\\nThen, it loops through the array using the `enumerated()` method to get both the `index` and `value` of each element in the array. For each element, it checks if the difference between the `target` and the element is already in the dictionary. If it is, that means the current element plus the element at the index in the dictionary adds up to the `target`, so it returns the indices of those two elements. If the difference is not in the dictionary, it adds the difference as a key and the `index` as a value to the dictionary. \\\\n\\\\nIf the loop is completed and no two elements in the array add up to the target, the function returns an empty array. \\\\n\\\\n## Complexity\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this approach has a time complexity of $$O(n)$$ because it only needs to loop through the array once, and a space complexity of $$O(n)$$ because it needs to store the dictionary.\\\\n\\\\n## Code\\\\n```swift\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {\\\\n        var dict = [Int: Int]()\\\\n        \\\\n        for (index, value) in nums.enumerated() {\\\\n            if let addent = dict[value] {\\\\n                return [addent, index]\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                dict[target - value] = index\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        return []\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# Third solution using Two Pointer\\\\n\\\\n## Approach\\\\n\\\\nThe approach used in this solution is a two-pointer approach. The given array of integers `nums` is first sorted in ascending order in the line `let sortedNums = nums.sorted()`.\\\\n\\\\nAfter sorting, two pointers `left` and `right` are initialized at the beginning and end of the sorted array respectively. The pointers are then moved inward from both ends towards the middle of the array while checking whether the sum of the values at these pointers is equal to the target value.\\\\n\\\\nIf the sum of the values at the `left` and `right` pointers is equal to the `target` value, the indices of these values in the initial unsorted array are returned. If the sum is less than the `target` value, the `left` pointer is moved one step to the `right`. If the sum is greater than the `target` value, the `right` pointer is moved one step to the `left`.\\\\n\\\\nThis process of incrementing and decrementing the pointers continues until the sum of the values at the pointers is equal to the `target` value, or the pointers meet in the middle and there are no more values to check.\\\\n\\\\n## Complexity\\\\n\\\\nThe time complexity of this approach is $$O(n^2)$$.\\\\n\\\\nThe space complexity is $$O(n)$$ due to the creation of a new sorted array.\\\\n\\\\n## Code\\\\n```\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\n    func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {\\\\n        let sortedNums = nums.sorted()\\\\n        var left = 0\\\\n        var right = nums.count - 1\\\\n\\\\n        while left < right {\\\\n            let sum = sortedNums[left] + sortedNums[right]\\\\n            if sum == target {\\\\n                if let index1 = nums.firstIndex(of: sortedNums[left]),\\\\n                   let index2 = nums.lastIndex(of: sortedNums[right]) {\\\\n                return [index1, index2]\\\\n                }\\\\n            } else if sum < target {\\\\n                left += 1\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                right -= 1\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\n        return []\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Upvote ^^\\\\n\\\\n![upvote.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0a04c379-6f12-48d1-8ee4-6bca3f1294ea_1681555786.816697.png)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n',\n",

These are their differences and the order of when they\\\\'ll be processed:\\\\n```\\\\n1. 9 - 2 = 7\\\\n2. 9 - 7 = 2\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFirst processed is `9 - 2`. Since difference is `7`, check if there is an element with key `7` in the map. In this case, not yet. But store `2, 0` pair.\\\\nThe next pair that will be processed: `9 - 7`. Check for existence of 2 in the map. In this case it exists so pull out the assigned index to it and create a resulting array.\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity: O(n) - worse case, there are no pairs and we iterate over every single item; fetching items from a map is 0(1)\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity: O(n) - we are using map to store the pairs\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\\\n * @param {number} target\\\\n * @return {number[]}\\\\n */\\\\nvar twoSum = function(nums, target) {\\\\n    let mp = new Map()\\\\n    \\\\n    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\\\n        let diff = target - nums[i]\\\\n        \\\\n        if (mp.has(diff)) {\\\\n            return [i, mp.get(diff)]\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        mp.set(nums[i], i)\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\",\n",

Hash Table approach\\\\nA better solution is to use a dictionary. First thing is first, we all know retreiving elements from dictionary is lightning fast since its based on hash maps. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, imagine all numbers were actually in a dictionary instead of an array. Then, when you are traversing in the outer loop, you can just say `if (dict.contains(target - currentElement))` to see if the matching pair of the current element is in the dictionary. \\\\nBelow, you can see that logic. Read and let it sink.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nvar pairs = new Dictionary<int, int>();\\\\nfor(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\\\n    if(pairs.ContainsKey(target - nums[i]))\\\\n        return new int[] { pairs[target - nums[i]], i };\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, we dont have all the elements in the dictionary at the beginning of the traversal, so we need to keep adding elements to dictionary if its pair is not found (i.e. the task isnt over yet).\\\\nThat\\\\'s why we need an `else` block to add the element to the dict.\\\\n```\\\\n    else\\\\n        pairs.TryAdd(nums[i], i);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n##### Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n$$O(n)$$\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\n $$O(n)$$\\\\n\\\\n##### Code\\\\n```\\\\npublic class Solution \\\\n{\\\\n    public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) \\\\n    {\\\\n        var pairs = new Dictionary<int, int>();\\\\n        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\\\n            if(pairs.ContainsKey(target - nums[i]))\\\\n                return new int[] { pairs[target - nums[i]], i };\\\\n            else\\\\n                pairs.TryAdd(nums[i], i);\\\\n        \\\\n        return default;\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n```\",\n",

Create a class named `Solution`.\\\\n2. Declare a member function `twoSum` that takes a vector of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`target`) as parameters.\\\\n3. Declare a variable `n` and assign it the size of the `nums` vector.\\\\n4. Declare a vector of integers named `output` with two elements, initialized to 0.\\\\n5. Use a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of numbers from the `nums` vector.\\\\n6. The outer loop variable `i` will iterate from 0 to `n - 1`.\\\\n7. The inner loop variable `j` will iterate from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.\\\\n8. Check if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` equals the `target`.\\\\n9. If the condition is satisfied, update the `output` vector with the indices `i` and `j`.\\\\n10. Return the `output` vector as the solution.\\\\n11.

For second ieration of the loop the element is 7 and to make sum 9 we need the element 9-7=2. Now searching that if two presented in the map and the ans is yes so if condition executed and pushing the index of element 2 to the vector and the inde of 7 also and return it.\\\\n\\\\n**Test Case 2:**\\\\n[3,3] and target = 6.\\\\n1. First we insert the first element of the array i.e. 3 into the map.\\\\n2. Now the map contain [3,0].\\\\n3. Now we iterate the for loop from 1. So nums[i] i.e. nums[1]=3.

Given an array, we have to find if there exists any pair of distinct elements (differring in their indices) which add up to target. Formally, given an array nums, we need to return {i, j} where i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\'s first write a brute force solution (implementing what was explained above):\\\\n\\\\n**Brute force solution 1:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            /* for each element nums[i], go through the whole array\\\\n               again to see if there is an element target - nums[i] at\\\\n               an index other than i\\\\n            */\\\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\\\n                if (i != j && nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\\\\n                    // found the pair\\\\n                    return {i, j};\\\\n                }\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity  : O(n ^ 2)\\\\nSpace complexity: O(1)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nNow, let\\\\'s try to optimise the above brute force solution to make it faster. How do we do that?\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\'s make some observations. If for indices i and j, nums[i] + nums[j] != target, then we can be sure that nums[j] + nums[i] will also not be equal to target. Let me explain what I mean by this through an example:\\\\n\\\\nTake an example array `nums = [3, 4, 6]` and `target = 8`\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [3, 4, 6]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t       |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t   j\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nif `nums[i] + nums[j] != target`, then we can be sure that:\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t j\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [3, 4, 6]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t       |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t   i\\\\n```\\\\n`nums[i] + nums[j]` won\\\\'t be equal to target. So, in other words, for an element `nums[i]`, we don\\\\'t have to check for any index `j (j < i)` if `nums[i] = nums[j] == target`.\\\\n\\\\nThis would make the brute force solution faster. Let\\\\'s see it\\\\'s implementation:\\\\n\\\\n**Brute force solution 2:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\\\\n                /* since we start checking from index i+1, we don\\\\'t\\\\n                   need to do i != j check inside the if condition\\\\n                */\\\\n                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\\\\n                    return {i, j};\\\\n                }\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity  : O(n ^ 2)\\\\nSpace complexity: O(1)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nWe know that O(n ^ 2) is quite slow. So let\\\\'s try to come up with a better algorithm. To do so, let\\\\'s try to come back to the problem statement. We need to find a pair of distinct elements `nums[i] and nums[j]` which add up to `target`. So, in other words, for each element `nums[i]`, we want to see if there exists an element `target - nums[i]` in the array `nums`. If there is, then we\\\\'ve just found the pair. We can use binary search to know if the compliment element exists or not.\\\\n\\\\n```text\\\\nQuestion:\\\\nWe can find if an element exists in the array by using binary search. But what\\\\nabout the indices of the pair of elements? We have to again linearly search for\\\\nthe indices of these elements right?\\\\n\\\\nAnswer:\\\\nTrue. But there is an alternative. We can form a nested list in which each element \\\\nwould have two elements. The first one being the element itself and the other the \\\\nindex of this element. We can sort this list before doing binary search. This way, \\\\nwhen we find the correct pair, we can just directly return the indices.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Idea to implement the binary search:**\\\\n\\\\nAlthough we can implement binary search like we saw above, we can face a small issue. This issue can be seen from the following example:\\\\n\\\\nIf the array `nums = [4, 1, 2, 6]` and `target = 8`. While looking for `target - nums[0]` we get 4. If we use binary search to find it, we might end up getting the element at the same index. We don\\\\'t want this. So, to avoid this, we will limit our search space to [0, i-1]. Since, one solution is guaranteed to exist, we can be sure that our binary search will get the correct answer when we encounter the bigger number of the pair.\\\\n\\\\n**Binary search implementation:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    /* This function returns (true, index) if element is found otherwise\\\\n       it returns (false, -1)\\\\n    */\\\\n    std::pair<bool,int> binary_search(std::vector<std::pair<int,int>>& a, int ind, int key) {\\\\n        int i = 0, j = ind - 1;\\\\n        while (i <= j) {\\\\n            int m = (i + j) / 2;\\\\n            if (a[m].first == key) {\\\\n                return std::make_pair(true, a[m].second);\\\\n            } else if (a[m].first < key) {\\\\n                i = m + 1;\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                j = m - 1;\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        return std::make_pair(false, -1);\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        // Making the nested list\\\\n        std::vector<std::pair<int,int>> a {};\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            a.push_back(std::make_pair(nums[i], i));\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        // Sorting the array so that binary search can be used\\\\n        std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());\\\\n        \\\\n        // Finding the pair using binary search\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            int key = target - a[i].first;\\\\n            std::pair<bool,int> res = binary_search(a, i, key);\\\\n            \\\\n            // found the pair\\\\n            if (res.first == true) {\\\\n                return {a[i].second, res.second};\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        /* This is written to avoid the compiler warning of not returning \\\\n           anything from the function which has a return type of vector<int>\\\\n        */\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N logN)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nBinary search works much faster than the brute force solution. That being said, it wasn\\\\'t the easiest to implement.\\\\n\\\\nWe can also solve this problem using two pointers instead of binary search to find the compliment. If you don\\\\'t know how two pointers method works, I\\\\'ll try to explain it with the following example.\\\\n\\\\nConsider an sorted array `nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]` and `target = 12`\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1:** First we create two variables pointing to first and last elements of a sorted array, `i = 0` and `j = n - 1` where `n` is the size of the array nums.\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t      j\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2:** Now, check compare `nums[i] + nums[j]` with `target`. if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`, we have found the pair. If `nums[i] + nums[j] < target` we have to increase the sum and this can only be done by moving the `i` pointer forward. If `nums[i] + nums[j] > target`, then we need to decrease the sum which can only be done by decrementing `j` pointer.\\\\n\\\\nSince (1 + 10) is less than 12, we increment `i` pointer.\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t     |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t      j\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3:** Now, the array looks something like this:\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t    i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t        |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t      j\\\\n```\\\\nSince (3 + 10) is greater than 12, decrement `j` pointer.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4:** Now the array looks like:\\\\n```cpp\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t    i\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t        |\\\\n                         nums = [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  |\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  j\\\\n```\\\\nNow, (3 + 9) is equal to 12. So, we have found the pair.\\\\n\\\\nThis is how the concept of two pointers work. I hope you understood it. If something is still unclear, I suggest you to take an example array of your own (remember to sort it) and follow the steps explained above and it\\\\'ll be clear in no time :)\\\\n\\\\nNow, similar to binary search implementation, we need to have a nested list with values and indices so that when we get such a valid pair, we can immediately output the indices without having to again find the indices individually.\\\\n\\\\n**Two Pointers implementation:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        \\\\n        // making the nested list\\\\n        std::vector<std::pair<int,int>> a {};\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\\\n            a.push_back(std::make_pair(nums[i], i));\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        // sorting the list\\\\n        std::sort(a.begin(), a.end());\\\\n        \\\\n        // using two pointers approach to find the pair\\\\n        int i = 0, j = n - 1;\\\\n        while (i < j) {\\\\n            int sum = a[i].first + a[j].first;\\\\n            if (sum == target) {\\\\n                // found pair so return answer\\\\n                return {a[i].second, a[j].second};\\\\n            } else if (sum < target) {\\\\n                i++;\\\\n            } else {\\\\n                j--;\\\\n            }\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n        /* This is just to avoid the compiler warning of not returning anything from\\\\n           a function with a return type of vector<int>\\\\n        */\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N logN)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\nNow let\\\\'s try to optimise the search for the compliment (target - nums[i]) even more. Since we know that an unordered_map has constant O(1) insertion, deletion and look-up on average, we can use it to our advantage. We can instantly check if the compliment element exists in the array.\\\\n\\\\n```text\\\\nQuestion 1:\\\\nBut what if target is twice an element in nums[i]. There is a possibility that we \\\\nend up finding the element at the same index if it occurs only once.\\\\nfor eg: nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 4;\\\\n\\\\nAnswer 1:\\\\nSo, to avoid this issue, we\\\\'ll only be looking at elements which are already in the \\\\nunordered_map like we did in binary search. So, for ith element, we\\\\'ll be \\\\nchecking if target - nums[i] exists in the map. Since we know that a pair is \\\\nguarenteed to exist, we\\\\'ll get it when we encounter the second element of that \\\\nvalid pair in the array.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQuestion 2:\\\\nBut what if there are multiple occurrences of same element which add up to \\\\ntarget? How will we store their indices to get distinct indices? \\\\nfor eg: nums = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 4\\\\n\\\\nAnswer:\\\\nIt still wouldn\\\\'t be a problem. Just update the value of that key to the latest \\\\nindex. If there are multiple occurrences of that element and they add up to \\\\ntarget, then we will find the pair when we encounter the first occurrence of \\\\nthat element.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation using unordered_map:**\\\\n```cpp\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        std::unordered_map<int,int> m;\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)nums.size(); i++) {\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t    // checking if target - nums[i] already exists in the map\\\\n            if (m.count(target - nums[i])) {\\\\n                return {i, m[target - nums[i]]};\\\\n            }\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t// if it does not, then just update the map with the current element\\\\n            m[nums[i]] = i;\\\\n        }\\\\n        \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t/* This is just to avoid the compiler warning of not returning anything\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t    from a function with a return type of vector<int>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t*/\\\\n        return {};\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** We can also use a `std::map` instead of `std::unordered_map` in the same implementation. Although the operations of look-up, insertion and deletion take O(log N) time in `std::map`, in practice it\\\\'s safer to use `std::map` over `std::unordered_map` even if it takes extra time sometimes. This is because it\\\\'s quite possible for `std::unordered_map` to have unusually high collisions for a given input making it very very slow.\\\\n\\\\nFor `std::map` implementation of above code:\\\\nTime complexity   : O(N logN)\\\\nSpace complexity : O(N)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n****\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n***Thanks for reading the article.

       "    'content': \"# Intuition\\\\nThe problem is asking us to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value. One straightforward approach is to use a nested loop to check every possible pair of numbers and see if their sum is equal to the target value. However, this would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not very efficient for large input arrays.\\\\n\\\\n# Approach\\\\nA better approach is to use a hash table to store the index of each number in the array as we loop through it. For each number, we calculate its complement (i.e. the value that would add up to the target value if added to the current number) and check if it\\\\'s already in the hash table. If it is, then we\\\\'ve found the pair of numbers that add up to the target value. If it\\\\'s not, then we add the current number and its index to the hash table and continue looping.\\\\n\\\\n# Complexity\\\\n- Time complexity:\\\\n- Time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums  \\\\nThis is because we are looping through the array once and doing constant-time operations for each element.\\\\n\\\\n- Space complexity:\\\\n- Space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums\\\\nThis is because we are using a hash map to store the index of each element, and the worst-case scenario is when all the elements are unique, so the hash map would have to store all n elements\\\\n\\\\nI have tried this problem in each approach\\\\n# Code\\\\n```\\\\n/**\\\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\\\n * @param {number} target\\\\n * @return {number[]}\\\\n */\\\\n\\\\nfunction twoSum(nums, target) {\\\\n  const map = new Map();\\\\n  \\\\n  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\\\n    const x = target - nums[i];\\\\n    \\\\n    if (map.has(x)) {\\\\n      return [map.get(x), i];\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    map.set(nums[i], i);\\\\n  }\\\\n  \\\\n  return [];\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n// const twoSum = function(nums, target) {\\\\n//     let index =[];\\\\n//     for (let i=0; i<nums.length-1; i++){\\\\n//         for (let j=i+1; j<nums.length; j++){\\\\n//             if(nums[i] + nums[j] === target){\\\\n//                 index.push(i);\\\\n//                 index.push(j);\\\\n//                 //  index =[i, j];\\\\n//             }\\\\n//         }\\\\n//     }\\\\n//     return index;\\\\n// };\\\\n\\\\n// const twoSum =(nums, target)=>{\\\\n//     //nums=nums.sort()\\\\n//     let left =0;\\\\n//     let right = nums.length-1;\\\\n\\\\n//     while(left<right){\\\\n//        let sum = nums[left]+ nums[right];\\\\n\\\\n//     if(sum == target) return [left,right]\\\\n//     if(sum< target) left++;\\\\n//     if(sum> target) right--;\\\\n\\\\n//     }\\\\n// }\\\\n\\\\n// function twoSum(a,b){\\\\n//     // let idx=[];\\\\n//     for(let i=0; i<a.length; i++){\\\\n//         for(let j=i+1; j<a.length; j++){\\\\n//             if(a[i]+a[j]=== b){\\\\n//                 idx =[i,j]\\\\n//             }\\\\n//         }\\\\n//     }\\\\n//     return idx;\\\\n// }\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n//  var twoSum = function (nums, target) {\\\\n//      for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){\\\\n//          for(let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++){\\\\n//              if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target){\\\\n//                  return [i,j]\\\\n//              }\\\\n//          }\\\\n//      }\\\\n//  }\\\\n```\",\n",

       " 'content': '# Intuition\\\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\\\nThe Two Sum problem asks us to find two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. We need to return the indices of these two numbers.\\\\n# Approach\\\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\\\n1. One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target. This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).\\\\n2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table.\\\\n\\\\n**Approach using a hash table:**\\\\n1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.\\\\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\\\\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].\\\\n4. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.\\\\n5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash table with its index as the value.\\\\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.\\\\n7. If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) since hash table lookups take constant time on average. It allows us to solve the Two Sum problem efficiently by making just one pass through the array.\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n# Solution 1: (Brute Force)\\\\n```C++ []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        for (int i = 0;

       "  'content': '# Intuition\\\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\\\nThe Two Sum problem asks us to find two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. We need to return the indices of these two numbers.\\\\n# Approach\\\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\\\n1. One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target. This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).\\\\n2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table.\\\\n\\\\n**Approach using a hash table:**\\\\n1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.\\\\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\\\\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].\\\\n4. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.\\\\n5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash table with its index as the value.\\\\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.\\\\n7. If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) since hash table lookups take constant time on average. It allows us to solve the Two Sum problem efficiently by making just one pass through the array.\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n# Solution 1: (Brute Force)\\\\n```C++ []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        for (int i = 0;

We need to return the indices of these two numbers.\\\\n# Approach\\\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\\\n1. One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target. This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).\\\\n2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table.\\\\n\\\\n**Approach using a hash table:**\\\\n1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.\\\\n2. Iterate through the array from left to right.\\\\n3. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].\\\\n4. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.\\\\n5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash table with its index as the value.\\\\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.\\\\n7. If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) since hash table lookups take constant time on average. It allows us to solve the Two Sum problem efficiently by making just one pass through the array.\\\\n\\\\n# Code\\\\n# Solution 1: (Brute Force)\\\\n```C++ []\\\\nclass Solution {\\\\npublic:\\\\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\\\n        int n = nums.size();\\\\n        for (int i = 0;
