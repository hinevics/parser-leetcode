# LeetCode Task Collector

![LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/static/images/LeetCode_logo.png)

The LeetCode Task Collector project aims to gather algorithmic tasks from leetcode.com. It collects all the necessary information about each task, including the task description, available solution options, ratings of the creators, and other relevant details.

## Project Description

### How It Works

1. User publishes their solution to a problem on the platform.
2. The application analyzes the solution and extracts key features or characteristics.
3. The service searches its database for other solutions that have similar features or characteristics.
4. The application presents the user with a list of similar solutions, ranked by relevance.

The LeetCode Task Collector project allows you to:
- Collect links to algorithmic tasks from leetcode.com
- Obtain algorithm descriptions for each task
- Collect all solution options for the tasks, including metadata

## TODO
- [ ] Implement workflow management and DAG execution using Apache Airflow
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application
- [ ] Gather additional information about solution authors, task numbers, ratings, and more
